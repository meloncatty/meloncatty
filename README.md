ðŸŒž Hello! I'm Krista Handel, an independent front-end web developer. My areas of focus within web development are accessibility, responsive design, and performance. My main tools are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently sharpening my CSS skills and building upon my web performance knowledge. I am patiently waiting to hear back from the Trusted Tester team so that I can become certified.
