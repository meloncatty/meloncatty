ðŸŒž Hello! I'm Krista, a front-end web developer. My areas of focus within web development are accessibility, responsive design, and performance. My main tools are JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I've been working on adding TypeScript to my developer toolbox.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently sharpening my CSS skills and building upon my web performance knowledge. I have recently become Trusted Tester certified and hope to obtain more certificates related to accessible web content.
